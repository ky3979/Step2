# Step2
This assignment introduced Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and creation of an application with a graphical user interface to me.
For this assignment, we created an aquarium. The user is able to add items to the aquarium via a menu on the top of the program. You can add fish to the aquarium and drag them around.

TODO:
- Save the state of the aquarium
- Animations for the items
