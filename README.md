# Step2
This assignment introduces Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and creation of an application with a graphical user interface in C++.

For this assignment, we created an aquarium. The user is able to add items to the aquarium via a menu on the top of the program. You can add fish to the aquarium and drag them around.

The next assignment in the class we will extend on this assignment and add:
- Save the state of the aquarium
- Animations for the fish
